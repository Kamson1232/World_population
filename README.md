# World_population

This is my project about world population living in cities or other urbanised areas.
Folders conatin following files:

raw_data - absolutely raw form downloaded from UNdata and a little cleaned form done by simple excel
clean_data - those are files with organised data after innitial analysis (what might be used in visualization)
python_code - python code that does the importing, cleaning, analysis and exporting


I actually have no clue what should be written here.
#First thing that comes to my mind is just a little explanation what does this repository contains.
